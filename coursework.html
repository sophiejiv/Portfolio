        <p>This course provides me with a foundation for understanding psychological, economic, management and sociocultural perspectives of work in the post-industrial age coming to be known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution or Industry 4.0. In this course, I have learned to recognize and discuss the challenges associated with information environments and work in the post-industrial age along with their implications for organizations, the people who work for them, and other relevant stakeholders. I have explored the design of information systems and their role in digital transformation of work and the workplace. This course focuses heavily on the challenges and opportunities of working at the frontiers of this new industrial revolution.  </p>
        
        <h2>SI 206: Data-Oriented Programming:</h2>
        <p> This course has helped me develop core programming and software development skills, to build competency and literacy in important areas that includes basic data structures, debugging and testing, using distributed code repositories, pattern matching, and programmatic gathering and processing of data. Applications in assignments and labs are oriented around data manipulation.
