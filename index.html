        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p> Hello! My name is Sophie Jivotovski (she/her) and I am a junior at the Universty of Michigan studying Information Technology with a focus in User Experience Design within The School of Information. The School of Information focuses on delivering innovative, elegant, ethical solutions connecting people, information and technology. With a focus in User Experience Design, I am learning how to design, build and evaluate compelling interactive systems. I am fascinated by bridging the gap between technology, business, and people; enabling individuals to leverage technology in order to connect, collaborate, and achieve their goals. </p>
        <h3>Interests:</h3>
        <p>I am very passionate about dance. I was a competitive dancer for 15 years before starting at UM. I now am apart of a contemporary dance group on campus called Cadence and am pursuing a dance minor. I also enjoy traveling, listening to music and podcasts, and reading.</p>
        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p>My first semester at the School of Information has already taught me many valuable skills that have allowed me to view the world from a more technical lens. I am now proficient in Python which allows me to sort to sort, clean, and manipulate data to draw conclusions and solve problems by interacting with databases, like SQL. I am currently learning how to code HTML and CSS to design accessible and aesthetically pleasing websites. </p>
